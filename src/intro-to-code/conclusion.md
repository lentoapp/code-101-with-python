# Conclusion

We've finished the first chapter!

In **Intro to Code**, you learned about:
- the origin of computers and how code came to be, as well as how languages look
  like today
- the basic building blocks of code and Python: binary, variables, `if
  statements`, loops, operators, keywords, and functions
- basic data structures: strings, integers, booleans, lists, dictionaries

We also did a few practice problems together to reinforce your understanding of
these concepts, and talked about debugging as well as some common beginner
questions.

Pat yourself on the back! You've learned a lot. In the next chapter, we'll talk
more about how programmers and developers do their work. Take a break, touch
