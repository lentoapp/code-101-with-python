# Project: Guessing Game

Now that we've reviewed a bit about how the terminal works, let's build a basic
guessing game together that reviews all the concepts we've learned in the last
chapter. Create a new file in VSCode and follow along!

```py
correct_number = 88
print('The correct number is: ')
print(correct_number)
# output:
# 
# The correct number is:
# 88
```
Some concepts of note in this block:
- Variables: `correct_number` is a variable here. We're "labeling" the number
  `88` using the "name" of `correct_number`, so that when we print the variable on the 3rd line, Python outputs `88`
