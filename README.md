# Code 101 With Python

This is a short, non-comprehensive guide designed to get beginners up and
running with Python. We cover basic building blocks of code, working with IDEs
and terminals, git basics, packages, and more, along with a few exercises and
projects.

## Development
We build *Code 101 With Python* website using [`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook),
so you'll need to install that to work on the book:

```sh
brew install mdbook # on macOS using homebrew
cargo install mdbook # cross-platform if you have Rust installed
```
or visit their [releases page](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases).
